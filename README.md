# lbt-measures

:straight_ruler: :straight_ruler: :straight_ruler: Collection of measures that ship with the
Ladybug Tools plugins.

Most (if not all) of the measures in this gem can be found on the [BCL](https://bcl.nrel.gov/)
and are maintained by [NREL](https://www.nrel.gov/) or other contributors. However,
the versions of the measures in this gem are regularly tested for compatibility
with Ladybug Tools.

Given that different measures can have different authors, one should refer to the
individual license files with each measure for limitations about redistribution.
